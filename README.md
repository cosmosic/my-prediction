### The Brief

The application has 2 tabs: Images & Predictions.

#### Images

This tab gives the user capability to upload into memory (no need to call an API here) and manage a list of images which will be used for further processing. The list of images should be displayed in a tabular or grid format with the following information:

- A thumbnail of the image
- Filename of the Image
- Size of the image
- Time of Upload
- A button called "PREDICT".

On clicking the PREDICT button, the following should happen:

- The user is asked to fill out a ‘Title’ and ‘Description’ for the prediction should be displayed. The user can either submit the prediction or cancel the operation:
- On clicking submit the request to the JSON server should be made, saving the response against the image.
  - On successful completion of the API request a single new entry would be added to the Predictions tab.

#### Predictions

- Thumbnail of the preidction
- Title (as selected by the user when submitting the prediction)

  over the image for all items predicted within an image, the image and prediction should be
